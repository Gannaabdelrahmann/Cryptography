## 📌 Algorithms Included

### 🔁 LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register)
- A simple pseudo-random bit generator.
- Often used in stream ciphers and hardware applications.
- File: `LFSR.java`

### 🔐 DES (Data Encryption Standard)
- A block cipher that encrypts data in 64-bit blocks using a 56-bit key.
- File: `DES.java`

### 🔐 AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- A modern symmetric encryption standard.
- Supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits.
- File: `AES.java`

### 🔐 RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)
- A public-key cryptosystem used for secure data transmission.
- File: `RSA.java`

## 🧪 How to Run

Each algorithm has its own `main()` method and can be compiled and run
